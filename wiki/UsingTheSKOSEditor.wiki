#summary One-How to use the SKOS editor to create a new SKOS vocabulary.

= Introduction =

The SKOS editor plugin is currently a prototype and we are now working on a fully functioning version. If you want to have a go with the current version it should be usable for viewing existing SKOS files.

If you want to use it to create a new SKOS vocabulary, you have to jump through a few hoops with this version. But it can be done!! :-)

1. I have created a small ontology in RDF to represent the core SKOS data model.Open Proeteg and import this ontology from here http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sjupp/ontologies/skos-core.rdf

2. You need to create an individual in the individuals tab and make this a type of ConceptScheme.

3. Make another individual and make this a type of Concept. 

4. Create a object property assertion betweeen your concept scheme and your concept using the hasTopConcept property. 

5. Make another object property assertion between your concept and your concept scheme individual using the skos:inScheme property. 

6. That should be enough for you start building a SKOS using the editor. 

A new version that work properly should be released sometime in the summer of 2008.....

Simon.
